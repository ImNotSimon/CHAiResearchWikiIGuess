 This is a page about everyone's favorite feature, the filter. Obvious irony.

As far as I know, and from messing around with the Tamper Chrome extension, I think the filter works via "candidates" (because the URL parameter "filtercandidates" exists (put &filtercandidates=false or true at the end of the url, it wont do anything) and that the response from the server on a filter error says "No eligible candidates")

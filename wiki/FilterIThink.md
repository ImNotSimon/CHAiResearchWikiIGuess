 This is a page about everyone's favorite feature, the filter. Obvious irony.

As far as I know, and from messing around with the Tamper Chrome extension, I think the filter works via "candidates" (because the URL parameter "filter_candidates" exists (put &filter_candidates=false or true at the end of the url, it wont do anything OTHER than display text on a corner of the screen) and that the response from the server on a filter error says "No eligible candidates")
